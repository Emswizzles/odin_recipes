        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This recipe is for simple vanilla cupcakes</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>120g butter, softened</li>
            <li>120g caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>120g self-raising flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases.</li>
            <li>Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and mix into the butter mixture along with the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Fold in the flour, adding a little milk until the mixture is of a dropping consistency. Spoon the mixture into the paper cases until they are three quarters full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into one of the cakes comes out clean. Set aside to cool for 5-10 minutes. Then place on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
