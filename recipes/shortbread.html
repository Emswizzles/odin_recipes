        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>150g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>100g butter, chilled and cubed</li>
            <li>50g caster sugar, plus 1 tbsp for sprinkling</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven 170C/150C fan/gas 3. Put the flour, butter and sugar into a mixing bowl. Use your hands to combine the ingredients until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then squeeze until it comes together as a dough.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to Â½ cm thick. Cut the dough into fingers and place on a lined baking tray. Use a fork to create imprints, then sprinkle with the remaining caster sugar.</li>
            <li>Chill the dough in the fridge for 20 mins, then bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown. Remove the shortbread fingers from the oven and leave to cool on the tray for 10 mins.</li>
        </ol>
